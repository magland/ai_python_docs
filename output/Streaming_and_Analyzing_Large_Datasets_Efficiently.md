# Streaming and Analyzing Large Datasets Efficiently with pynapple

In this guide, we will explore how to efficiently stream large datasets using pynapple, a powerful Python package for time-series analysis. We'll specifically focus on how pynapple can help manage memory usage even when dealing with large datasets.

## Overview

Pynapple supports lazy loading and streaming of data directly from files without loading the entire dataset into memory. This feature is particularly useful when working with large datasets stored in formats like NWB. You can utilize pynapple to stream data directly, process it, and perform analyses without consuming excessive memory.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installing Required Packages

Before we start, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install pynapple matplotlib seaborn dandi
```

### Step 2: Streaming Data from DANDI Archive

The DANDI Archive is a common source for large neuroscience datasets stored in the NWB format. To stream data directly from DANDI without downloading the entire file, follow the steps below:

```python
from pynwb import NWBHDF5IO
from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient
import fsspec
from fsspec.implementations.cached import CachingFileSystem
import h5py

# Example DANDI dataset
dandiset_id, filepath = ("000582", "sub-10073/sub-10073_ses-17010302_behavior+ecephys.nwb")

with DandiAPIClient() as client:
    asset = client.get_dandiset(dandiset_id, "draft").get_asset_by_path(filepath)
    s3_url = asset.get_content_url(follow_redirects=1, strip_query=True)

# Create a virtual filesystem based on the HTTP protocol
fs = fsspec.filesystem("http")

# Create a cache to save downloaded data to disk (optional)
fs = CachingFileSystem(
    fs=fs,
    cache_storage="nwb-cache",  # Local folder for the cache
)

# Open the file
file = h5py.File(fs.open(s3_url, "rb"))
io = NWBHDF5IO(file=file, load_namespaces=True)
```

### Step 3: Loading Data with pynapple

Once you have the NWB file interface, you can load data using pynapple's `NWBFile` class. This class provides a way to interact with datasets without fully loading them into memory:

```python
import pynapple as nap

nwb = nap.NWBFile(io.read())
print(nwb)

# Load specific data streams dynamically
units = nwb["units"]  # Spike times
position = nwb["SpatialSeriesLED1"]  # Position data
```

### Step 4: Analyzing Data

Pynapple offers various functions for analyzing time series without loading the entire dataset at once. For example, you can compute tuning curves directly on streamed data:

```python
tc, binsxy = nap.compute_2d_tuning_curves(units, position, nb_bins=20)

# Plotting tuning curves
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))
for i, tcurve in tc.items():
    plt.subplot(2, 4, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(tcurve, origin="lower", aspect="auto")
    plt.title(f"Unit {i}")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 5: Managing Memory Usage

To ensure efficient memory usage, pynapple uses lazy loading and keeps datasets in a memory-mapped format (e.g., using `np.memmap` or loading segments as needed). This means you work with data directly from storage, minimizing in-memory footprint.

### Tips for Efficient Streaming

- **Use Lazy Loading:** Ensure data is accessed as required and not fully loaded into memory.
- **Segment Processing:** Process data in chunks or intervals as supported by pynapple's functions.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Take advantage of pynapple's native objects like `Tsd`, `TsdFrame`, etc., which are optimized for handling time-indexed data efficiently.

### Conclusion

By leveraging pynapple's strengths in streaming and efficient memory management, you can handle large datasets with ease. This makes pynapple an excellent choice for scenarios where computational efficiency and resource management are critical.
