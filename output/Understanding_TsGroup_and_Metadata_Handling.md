# Understanding TsGroup and Metadata Handling

## Introduction
The `TsGroup` class in `pynapple` is designed to manage multiple time series that might have different timestamps while allowing for easy manipulation and analysis of associated metadata. This guide will walk you through how to create, access, and utilize `TsGroup` objects, as well as how to handle metadata effectively.

## Creating a TsGroup

1. **Import Required Libraries**:
    You must have `pynapple` installed. Import the necessary libraries:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import pynapple as nap
    ```

2. **Generate Time Series**:
    Create multiple `Ts` objects that represent different time series data. This can be done using numpy's random functions or any desired dataset.
    ```python
    ts1 = nap.Ts(t=np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, 100, 1000)), time_units="s")
    ts2 = nap.Ts(t=np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, 100, 2000)), time_units="s")
    ts3 = nap.Ts(t=np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, 100, 1500)), time_units="s")
    ```

3. **Organize into TsGroup**:
    Combine your time series into a `TsGroup`. You can optionally pass metadata as additional arguments.
    ```python
    my_ts = {0: ts1, 1: ts2, 2: ts3}
    tsgroup = nap.TsGroup(my_ts, time_units="s")
    ```

## Accessing Time Series

1. **Indexing**:
    You can access individual time series using standard dictionary-like indexing.
    ```python
    print(tsgroup[0])  # Access the first time series
    ```

2. **List-Like Indexing**:
    Access multiple time series using list indexing.
    ```python
    print(tsgroup[[0, 2]])  # Access the first and third time series
    ```

## Manipulating TsGroup

1. **Restricting by Time Intervals**:
    Use the `restrict` method to filter time series data based on specific intervals.
    ```python
    intervals = nap.IntervalSet(start=20, end=40)
    restricted_tsgroup = tsgroup.restrict(intervals)
    ```

2. **Applying Functions**:
    Functions such as `count` can be directly applied to `TsGroup` to analyze the data collectively.
    ```python
    count_result = tsgroup.count(1, intervals, time_units="s")  # Count elements within bins of 1 second
    ```

3. **Getting Information**:
    You can retrieve metadata from each `Ts` object using the `get_info` method, or by treating them as attributes.
    ```python
    print(tsgroup[0].get_info("your_metadata_key"))  # Access specific metadata
    ```

## Adding and Modifying Metadata

1. **Creating Metadata**:
    You can create pandas Series or numpy arrays to store metadata.
    ```python
    labels = pd.Series(index=list(my_ts.keys()), data=["Neuron A", "Neuron B", "Neuron C"])
    ```

2. **Adding Metadata**:
    You can add the metadata during the initialization of `TsGroup` or afterwards using the `set_info` method.
    ```python
    tsgroup = nap.TsGroup(my_ts, time_units="s", neuron_labels=labels)
    tsgroup.set_info(my_additional_metadata=np.array([1, 2, 3]))  # Add additional metadata
    ```

3. **Viewing Metadata**:
    Access metadata directly using attributes or get_info method.
    ```python
    print(tsgroup.neuron_labels)  # Access the neuron labels directly
    ```

4. **Slicing Based on Metadata**:
    You can slice through the `TsGroup` based on the values in your metadata.
    ```python
    filtered_group = tsgroup[tsgroup.my_label1 == 0]  # Filter based on a metadata column
    ```

## Conclusion
The `TsGroup` class in `pynapple` offers a robust tool for organizing and analyzing groups of time series data, along with associated metadata. By following the steps in this guide, you can efficiently manipulate and extract meaningful insights from your data collections.
