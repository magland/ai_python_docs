# Advanced Time Series Manipulation with Pynapple

In this guide, we'll delve deeper into the intricate functionalities of `pynapple` for handling time series data. We'll explore slicing, indexing, and arithmetic operations, specifically tailored for the diverse datasets encountered in neuroscience research.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pynapple matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn
```

## Step 1: Understanding the Time Series Objects

`pynapple` offers multiple time series objects, each suited for different types of data:

- **`TsdTensor`**: Handles data with more than two dimensions, such as video data.
- **`TsdFrame`**: Suitable for column-based multi-dimensional data and can be easily converted to a `pandas.DataFrame`.
- **`Tsd`**: Designed for one-dimensional time series and convertible to a `pandas.Series`.
- **`Ts`**: Captures timestamp-only data, like spike times.

## Step 2: Initializing Time Series Data

Let's start by creating different pynapple time series objects.

```python
import numpy as np
import pynapple as nap

# Creating a TsdTensor
tsdtensor = nap.TsdTensor(t=np.arange(100), d=np.random.rand(100, 5, 5), time_units="s")

# Creating a TsdFrame
tsdframe = nap.TsdFrame(t=np.arange(100), d=np.random.rand(100, 3), columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

# Creating a Tsd
tsd = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(100), d=np.random.rand(100))

# Creating a Ts
ts = nap.Ts(t=np.arange(100))
```

## Step 3: Slicing and Indexing

### Numpy-Like Slicing

Pynapple allows numpy-style slicing across its time series objects. The first dimension generally represents time.

```python
# Slicing first 10 elements from TsdTensor
print(tsdtensor[0:10]) 

# Accessing the first column of TsdFrame
print(tsdframe[:, 0])

# Getting the first element from TsdTensor
print(tsdtensor[0])
```

### Special Slicing with TsdFrame

`TsdFrame` offers advanced slicing analogous to `pandas.DataFrame`.

```python
# Access by column label
print(tsdframe.loc['a'])

# Access multiple columns
print(tsdframe.loc[['a', 'c']])
```

## Step 4: Arithmetic Operations

Pynapple provides seamless integration for performing arithmetic operations directly on its time series objects.

```python
# Adding a scalar to a Tsd
tsd = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(5), d=np.ones(5))
print(tsd + 1)

# Subtracting an array of same shape
print(tsd - np.ones(5))

# Note: Operations between two Tsd objects are not directly supported.
```

## Step 5: Array Operations and Other Functionalities

Pynapple integrates common numpy functions. For instance, it supports operations like averaging across specific dimensions.

```python
# Average along the time axis
print(np.mean(tsdtensor, 0))

# Average across the second dimension and get a TsdFrame
print(np.mean(tsdtensor, 1))
```

## Step 6: Concatenating and Splitting

### Concatenating

No overlapping in time indices is vital while concatenating:

```python
tsd1 = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(5), d=np.ones(5))
tsd2 = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(5)+10, d=np.ones(5)*2)
tsd3 = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(5)+20, d=np.ones(5)*3)

# Concatenation
print(np.concatenate((tsd1, tsd2, tsd3)))

# Vertical concatenation if time indices match
tsdframe_comb = nap.TsdFrame(t=np.arange(5), d=np.random.randn(5, 3))
print(np.concatenate((tsdframe_comb, tsdframe_comb), 1))
```

### Splitting

Array split functions for segmenting time series:

```python
print(np.array_split(tsdtensor[0:10], 2))
```

## Step 7: Modifying Time Series Data

Element-wise modifications or logical operations on time series data:

```python
# Modify element-wise
tsd1[0] = np.pi
print(tsd1)

# Modify using logical conditions
tsd[tsd.values > 0.5] = 0.0
print(tsd)
```

## Step 8: Sorting Constraints

Due to time index sorting, sorting along the first dimension is not recommended as it breaks the temporal order.

```python
try:
    np.sort(tsd)
except Exception as error:
    print(error)
```

## Conclusion

With these powerful slicing, indexing, and arithmetic capabilities, `pynapple` equips researchers to handle complex neuroscience time series data effectively. Ensure you explore more functionalities and adapt them as per your research requirements.
