# How-to Guide: NWB & Lazy-loading in Pynapple

Pynapple provides efficient handling and manipulation of NWB files via lazy-loading, which allows you to access large datasets without loading everything into memory at once. This guide will show you how to leverage these features effectively.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have pynapple installed and ready to use. You'll also need h5py, which pynapple uses to work with NWB files. You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pynapple h5py
```

## Step 1: Load a NWB File

You can load a NWB file using `nap.NWBFile`. This class supports lazy-loading, meaning it will only load data into memory when you explicitly request it.

```python
import pynapple as nap

# Provide the path to your NWB file
path = "path/to/your/file.nwb"

# Initialize NWBFile with lazy loading
data = nap.NWBFile(path, lazy_loading=True)

print(data)
```

This step will parse the NWB file and prepare it for lazy loading. It wonâ€™t load the data into memory yet.

## Step 2: Access Data Lazily

When you access a dataset from the NWB file, pynapple will initially return an HDF5 dataset instead of loading it into memory. You can perform operations on this dataset without fully loading it.

```python
# Access a dataset, e.g., local field potential (LFP) data
lfp_data = data['lfp']  # this is an example key, yours might differ

# Check the type
print(type(lfp_data.values))  # This will print something like h5py.Dataset
```

## Step 3: Load Specific Data Chunks

To actually load data into memory, you can access specific chunks of the dataset. This is particularly useful for processing large datasets by sections.

```python
# Load a specific chunk from the LFP data
chunk = lfp_data.get(0, 1000)  # Load the first 1000 samples

print(chunk)
print(type(chunk.values))  # This will print numpy.ndarray as it is loaded into memory now
```

## Step 4: Use Pynapple Functions on Lazy-loaded Data

Many pynapple functions support operations with lazy-loaded data. You can use these functions directly on your datasets without preloading all the data into memory.

```python
import numpy as np

# Compute tuning curves without preloading the entire session
tc = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(data['units'], data['y'], 10)

print(tc)
```

## Step 5: Disabling Lazy-loading

If you prefer to load everything into memory from the start, set `lazy_loading=False` when initializing the NWBFile.

```python
# Initialize NWBFile without lazy loading
data = nap.NWBFile(path, lazy_loading=False)

# Now accessing a dataset loads it into memory
loaded_data = data['lfp']
print(type(loaded_data.values))  # This will print numpy.ndarray, as it is now fully loaded
```

## Additional Tips

- Make sure your environment has sufficient memory when working with large datasets without lazy loading.
- Use lazy-loading for efficient processing and analysis of large datasets, particularly when working in resource-constrained environments.

This guide enables you to efficiently load and manipulate NWB files with the help of lazy-loading features in pynapple, optimizing both memory use and computation speed.
