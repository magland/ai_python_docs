# How-to Guide: Wavelet Parametrization for Time-Frequency Analysis

Wavelet transforms are a powerful tool in time-frequency analysis that can provide insights into how the spectral content of a signal changes over time. This guide will help you understand how the parameters of wavelets affect resolution and reconstruction fidelity.

## Overview
Wavelets are functions that can be used to decompose signals into components of various frequencies, enabling detailed analyses of changes over time. In pynapple, wavelets are particularly useful for observing neural signals, which may change rapidly. Here, the common method employed is the Morlet wavelet, which is useful in neuroscientific data analysis for spectral decomposition.

## Key Parameters
When performing a wavelet transform, several parameters significantly affect the analysis's outcome:

- **`gaussian_width`**: Controls the width of the wavelet in the frequency domain. A larger `gaussian_width` results in better frequency resolution but poorer time resolution.

- **`window_length`**: Represents the length of the wavelet in seconds. A longer `window_length` will increase the accuracy in frequency resolution at the cost of time resolution.

### Balancing Resolution and Reconstruction Fidelity
Choosing wavelet parameters involves trade-offs between time resolution (how accurately we can localize events in time) and frequency resolution (how accurately we can resolve different frequency components).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Generating the Filter Bank
You can generate a Morlet wavelet filter bank using `nap.generate_morlet_filterbank`, which helps parametrize and visualize the wavelets:

```python
import numpy as np
import pynapple as nap

# Define frequency range for analysis
freqs = np.linspace(1, 25, num=25)

# Get the filter bank with default parameters
filter_bank = nap.generate_morlet_filterbank(
    freqs, fs=1000, gaussian_width=1.5, window_length=1.0
)
```

### Step 2: Examining Wavelet Effects
By varying the `gaussian_width` and `window_length`, you can visualize how these parameters change the wavelet shape and impact analysis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualize the effect of different wavelet parameters
for window_length in [1.0, 2.0]:
    for gaussian_width in [1.5, 4.0]:
        wavelet = nap.generate_morlet_filterbank(
            np.array([1.0]), 1000, gaussian_width=gaussian_width, window_length=window_length, precision=12
        )[:, 0].real()
        plt.plot(wavelet, label=f'WL={window_length}, GW={gaussian_width}')
        plt.legend()
        plt.title("Parametrization Visualization")
        plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
        plt.show()
```

### Step 3: Computing the Wavelet Transform
Perform the wavelet transform using the chosen wavelet parameters:

```python
# Example signal
sig = nap.Tsd(t=np.linspace(0, 1, 1000), d=np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)))

# Compute wavelet transform
mwt = nap.compute_wavelet_transform(
    sig, fs=1000, freqs=freqs, gaussian_width=1.5, window_length=1.0, norm='l1'
)
```

### Step 4: Visualization of Time-Frequency Representation
Visualize the transformed signal to observe time-frequency patterns:

```python
def plot_timefrequency(freqs, powers, ax):
    im = ax.imshow(np.abs(powers), aspect="auto", origin="lower")
    ax.set_yticks(np.arange(len(freqs))[::2])
    ax.set_yticklabels(np.rint(freqs[::2]))
    ax.set_ylabel("Frequency (Hz)")
    return im
    
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
im = plot_timefrequency(freqs, np.transpose(mwt.values), ax=ax)
plt.colorbar(im, ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion
Properly adjusting wavelet parameters like `gaussian_width` and `window_length` is crucial for achieving the desired balance between time and frequency resolution. This guide has illustrated the process of setting parameter values, performing a wavelet transform, and visually interpreting the results. Experimenting with these parameters will allow you to better analyze your specific signal characteristics in time-frequency space.
