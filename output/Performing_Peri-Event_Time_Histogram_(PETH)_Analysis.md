Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide on performing Peri-Event Time Histogram (PETH) analysis using `pynapple`.

### Performing Peri-Event Time Histogram (PETH) Analysis

#### Introduction
Peri-Event Time Histogram (PETH) analysis is a method to align a variable of interest (like neural activity) to the occurrence of specific events (such as stimuli) to understand their relationship. This can help in examining the patterns of neural activity in response to stimuli.

#### Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure that you have the `pynapple` library installed and your data loaded. Your dataset should include both the neural activity time series and the timestamps of events you are interested in.

#### Steps

1. **Loading Your Data**: 
   First, load your neural activity and event timestamps using `pynapple`. The neural data should be in one of the `pynapple` time series formats (like `Ts`, `Tsd`, `TsdFrame`).

```python
import pynapple as nap

# Load your data
neural_data = nap.Tsd(...)  # Load or define your neural data time series
event_times = nap.Ts(...)   # Load or define your event timestamps
```

2. **Select Event of Interest**:
   Determine the specific event timestamps you want to analyze with respect to the neural data. This might include filtering or restricting specific types of events.

```python
# Assuming you have different types of events, filter for the specific type(s)
selected_events = event_times.restrict(...) # Use IntervalSet or other filtering as necessary
```

3. **Compute PETH**:
   Use the `compute_perievent` function from `pynapple` to calculate the PETH. The `minmax` parameter defines the time window around each event to consider.

```python
# Calculate the PETH using a window of -0.1 to 0.2 seconds around each event
peth = nap.compute_perievent(neural_data, selected_events, minmax=(-0.1, 0.2))
```

4. **Visualize the PETH**:
   Visualize the resulting PETH data, often as a raster plot or histogram, to analyze the pattern of neural activity around the event times.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plotting the PETH
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplot(211)
plt.plot(nap.sum(peth.count(0.01), 1), linewidth=3, color="red")
plt.xlim(-0.1, 0.2)
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.axvline(0.0)
plt.subplot(212)
plt.plot(peth.to_tsd(), "|", markersize=20, color="red", mew=4)
plt.xlabel("Time from event (s)")
plt.ylabel("Event")
plt.xlim(-0.1, 0.2)
plt.axvline(0.0)
plt.show()
```

5. **Interpret Results**:
   Analyze the graphs to interpret the relationship between the events and neural activity. Peaks or consistent patterns might indicate a response to the event.

#### Conclusion
PETH analysis with `pynapple` allows you to explore how neural activity correlates with specific events, providing insights into stimulus-response relationships. Customize your analysis further by varying the window size and selecting additional time series data as necessary.
