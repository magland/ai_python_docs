Certainly! Phase coupling analysis is a powerful technique to explore the relationship between neural spikes and oscillatory phases. In this guide, we will use the Pynapple package to apply phase coupling analysis to neural spikes by filtering the LFP signal, extracting its phase using the Hilbert transform, and then analyzing the spike-phase coupling. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Step-by-Step Guide: Applying Phase Coupling Analysis to Neural Spikes

#### Step 1: Load your data
First, you'll need LFP data and spike times data loaded into Pynapple objects (`Tsd` for time series data and `Ts` for timestamp data of spikes).

```python
import pynapple as nap

# Assuming you already have your data structured in pynapple compatible format
lfp = nap.Tsd(t=<time_array>, d=<lfp_data>)   # Replace <time_array> and <lfp_data> with your actual data
spikes = nap.Ts(t=<spike_times>)              # Replace <spike_times> with your actual spike times
```

#### Step 2: Select Frequency Band for Phase Analysis
Decide on the frequency band of interest. For example, you might be interested in the theta band (6-10 Hz).

```python
theta_band = (6.0, 10.0)  # Define your frequency band range
```

#### Step 3: Apply Bandpass Filter
Apply a bandpass filter to the LFP signal to isolate the oscillation of interest.

```python
filtered_lfp = nap.apply_bandpass_filter(lfp, cutoff=theta_band, fs=<sampling_rate>, mode='butter')
```

#### Step 4: Extract the Phase using Hilbert Transform
Compute the phase of the filtered signal using the Hilbert transform.

```python
import scipy.signal
phase = nap.Tsd(t=filtered_lfp.t, d=np.angle(scipy.signal.hilbert(filtered_lfp)))
```

#### Step 5: Determine Phase of Spikes
Align spike times to the phase of the oscillation.

```python
spike_phase = spikes.value_from(phase)
```

#### Step 6: Analyze Spike-Phase Coupling
Analyze the relationship between spikes and phase using tuning curves to visualize whether there is a preferred phase at which spikes occur.

```python
# Compute and plot phase modulation of spikes
phase_modulation = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(spikes, phase, nb_bins=60, minmax=(-np.pi, np.pi))

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure()
plt.plot(phase_modulation)
plt.xlabel('Phase (rad)')
plt.ylabel('Firing rate (Hz)')
plt.title('Spike-Phase Coupling')
plt.show()
```

### Summary
This analysis helps you to visualize and determine if spikes are more likely to occur at particular phases of an oscillatory rhythm. You will be able to observe how the phases might influence neural activity or identify phase preferences in the firing of neural populations, such as theta-modulated neurons in hippocampal datasets.
