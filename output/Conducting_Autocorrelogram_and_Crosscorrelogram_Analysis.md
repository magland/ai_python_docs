# How to Conduct Autocorrelogram and Crosscorrelogram Analysis with Pynapple

This guide demonstrates how to use the `pynapple` package to compute and interpret autocorrelograms and crosscorrelograms for assessing neuronal synchrony.

## Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

Ensure you have the required libraries installed using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pynapple
```

## Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries

Start by importing the required packages in your Python script or Jupyter notebook:

```python
import numpy as np
import pynapple as nap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## Step 3: Load Your Data

Assuming you have a dataset with spike times, you can create individual `Ts` objects for each neuron. Here’s an example of how to create a mock dataset:

```python
# Generate random spike times for two neurons
spike_times_neuron1 = np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, 100, 1000))  # 1000 spikes for neuron 1
spike_times_neuron2 = np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, 100, 800))   # 800 spikes for neuron 2

# Create spike train objects
neuron1 = nap.Ts(t=spike_times_neuron1, time_units="s")
neuron2 = nap.Ts(t=spike_times_neuron2, time_units="s")
```

If you are working with a real dataset, load it appropriately instead of generating synthetic data.

## Step 4: Compute Autocorrelogram

To compute the autocorrelogram for a single neuron, use the `compute_autocorrelogram` function. Specify the binsize and windowsize:

```python
autocorrs_neuron1 = nap.compute_autocorrelogram(
    group=neuron1, binsize=50, windowsize=1000, time_units="ms"
)
print(autocorrs_neuron1)
```

## Step 5: Compute Crosscorrelogram

To compute the crosscorrelogram between two neurons, use the `compute_crosscorrelogram` function:

```python
crosscorrs = nap.compute_crosscorrelogram(
    group=nap.TsGroup({0: neuron1, 1: neuron2}), binsize=50, windowsize=1000, time_units="ms"
)
print(crosscorrs)
```

## Step 6: Plotting Results

Now that you have computed the correlograms, you can visualize them. Here’s how to plot the autocorrelogram and crosscorrelogram:

### Plot Autocorrelogram

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(autocorrs_neuron1, color='blue', label='Neuron 1 Autocorrelogram')
plt.title('Autocorrelogram of Neuron 1')
plt.xlabel('Time Lag (ms)')
plt.ylabel('Counts')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Plot Crosscorrelogram

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(crosscorrs[0], color='green', label='Crosscorrelogram of Neuron 1 and Neuron 2')
plt.title('Crosscorrelogram of Neuron 1 and Neuron 2')
plt.xlabel('Time Lag (ms)')
plt.ylabel('Counts')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Step 7: Interpretation

1. **Autocorrelogram**: An autocorrelogram reveals the timing of a neuron's firing patterns. Peaks indicate periods when the neuron fired more synchronously.

2. **Crosscorrelogram**: This measures the relationship between the firing of two distinct neurons. Positive peaks indicate synchrony or correlation in firing, while negative peaks can indicate an inhibitory relationship.

By analyzing these correlograms, you can assess the synchrony between neuronal activity, which may be crucial for hypotheses related to functional connectivity in neural networks.

## Conclusion

Using `pynapple` for autocorrelogram and crosscorrelogram analysis provides a powerful approach to analyzing neuronal synchrony. By following the steps above, you can compute and visualize these metrics, thus gaining insights into your neuronal data. Adjust parameters as necessary to fit your specific experimental designs or hypotheses.
